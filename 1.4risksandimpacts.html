<h2> 1.4 - What risks cause digital projects to fail And Why?</h2>
</p>
<p>
There are and always will be things that don’t go to plan or work propperly like.
<ul>
<li>Faulty equipment</li>
<li>Power cuts / loss of power (not for laptops as they can potentially be ran off a battery for a period of time if need to be.)</li>
<li>Staff not complying or even abusing the rules set in place by the company.</li>
<li>Staff misusing or damaging your systems
<li>Compatibility in software</li>
<li>Security issues with staff and software</li>
<li>Hackers</li>
<li>Cyber criminals</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Faulty Equipment

This is a basic thing to avoid really all you will need your is your I.T team to maintain the equipment to the best of their abilities. This will ensure that everything will run smoothly and correctly.
</p>
<p>
Power cuts/ loss of power

As we all know from our home lives there is nothing much you can do about a power cut apart from rode it out. If this happens there is nothing you can about it affecting your servers and individual staff systems. To avoid this you could use laptops instead of desktop computers. This will give you the added bonus of still being able to work on the files but only if you were already working on it. Also you would have to wait until the power I back on to save the file back to the server.
</p>
<p>
Staff not complying or abusing rules

Yet again this is a basic thing to avoid all you would need is an internet filter like the ones schools use for there networks so the pupils don't go on any inappropriate or social media sites. All the filter does really is if you did type in an inappropriate site or social media site the filter would just bring a screen up saying this site has been blocked. This would stop the staff misusing the system for websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Rakuten, Amazon or even eBay. 
</p>
<p>
Damage to your systems
</p>
<p>
This area is similar to the one above but there are some differences. The first on is instead of using the systems to get yo websites or social media this area involves things like spillages. This could be as simple as a member of staff bringing a drink such as tea / coffee or water / juice back to there desks. Then as they reach to answer the phone or get an item from there desk they forget that the drink is there and then say this drink is spilt in to the laptop or desktop system this would then stop the keyboard or mouse working at the least but if you are unfortunate then this could damage internal components which could work out costly to repair. This could even go to criminal damage which would involve purposeful and physical intent to damaging the system (e.g physically breaking the screen or throwing the laptop or system.)
</p>
<p>
Compatibility

This really is one of the easiest to keep on top of it just basically is making sure everyone is running the same software (e.g Microsoft Word). Then apart from this it is making sure everyone has the up to date version of this software (e.g Microsoft word 2010 and 2019 may be the same programme but they are years apart in terms of software so this means functions in the new one may not be available in the earlier one. This works the other way round as well. That means that if some works from the new version and someone tries to open that same file on the older there is a good chance that it would appear different or have sections missing.
</p>
<p>
Security issues

As with everything there are a few ways that people get around security of computer systems. This can be as easy as someone having an easy to guess password (e.g first / last name or date of birth as there password.). as easy as it is to have an easy to break password staff could also write down password so they don't forget them and then leave them lying around the workspace or office for others to find and use. This may happen for just a few minutes if the member of staff was just going to the toilet or getting a drink of something. As well as just swapping passwords around the staff could just forget to log off when they leave the system which would be the same as passing the password on and let anyone access your system. As the system is then logged in to that user the person doing it would get away with anything they did as it would appear on the system that the person logged in did it all The members of staff could exchange passwords between themselves. This is usually going to supervisors or managers passing passwords down to level staff to access files and areas of the system that they are normally unable to access. That is the same as if the person logged themselves in and let another user do all the work as if it was them.
</p>
<p>
Hackers / Cyber criminal
</p>
<p>
There are several ways that someone may be able to access you systems and files. The list taken from an example website below shows some ways in which a company can be hacked or affected by someone outside of the company and how they carry this out. The website also explains these sections if you wanted any further information on these ways that a person could negatively influence / impact your business / company. 
<ol>
<li>Email social engineering / spear phishing.</li>
<li>Infection via a drive-by web download.</li>
<li>USB key malware.</li>
<li>Scanning networks for vulnerabilities and exploitment.</li>
<li>Guessing or social engineering passwords.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi compromises.</li>
<li>Stolen credentials from third party sites.</li> 
<li>Compromising web data bases.</li>
<li>Exploiting password reset services to hijack accounts.</li>
<li>Insiders.</li>
<li>Cyber espionage.</li>
</ol>
