<h1>Welcome To Gordon's Website</h1>

<h2>1.0 - A bit about myself and why I wanted to come and do this course by Code Nation</h2> 
<p>
When I left school I moved on to college and then did a 3 year BTEC course which was the equivalent to 3 A levels grade A-C. This course did cover all 3 areas of the science world Biology, Chemistry & Physics. I passed this course and received my certificate from the board who ran this course to say I did pass it. 
<p>
After that I then moved onto work at Tesco superstore in the Prestwich area of Manchester. I worked there for just short of 10 years in total. I started out on an 18 hour contract on the checkouts. I then got moved to the petrol station due to long term illness and on about 27.5 hours a week as a bonus. After this period which lasted about 6-7 months my manager asked if would like this job permanently but I refused kindly as this was not for me and there was not much interaction between me and the customers as much as there was on the checkouts area. I was then moved back to my usual area of checkouts but with the increased 27.5 hours that I got use to where I decided to push my self and up skill on the self service tills. So my manager kindly agreed and said of course as we think your personality would work great in this are. After I did the training along side multiple other colleagues to get to know everything and how to solve all the issues in and around this area I was left alone to do it by my self. Then my manager noticed how well I took to the self service area she decided that all or if not possible most of my time would be spent in this area. Then due to retirement there was an opening on this area but as part of the nights team which I took up immediately and this is where I spent the last 3-4 years of my Tesco career.
</p>
<p>
From Tesco I then moved on to become a manager at a Jewish bakery just outside of Manchester city center where I spent time getting use to my role. This included ordering and maintaining stock levels of all ingredients needed and boxes to put items into to go on and be sold. As well as all this I had to all the paperwork including invoices for shops and customers as well as keeping the safety records up to date for the health and safety people. 
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I like to research and study my hobbies which include aircraft both civil old and new and military old and new and. I am also in to cars yet again both classic and new.
</p>
<p>
I am also in to computers a lot and like to work with and repair both hardware and software if I was able to. I have done this in my spare time for friends and family and also colleagues. I didn't make money off this but I enjoyed doing this and it gave me a deeper understanding to how they work and how to step by step fix them. I also like to play games in my time as well usually driving and racing games such as forza motorsport series and far less realistic games such as need for speed and burnout series but I am quite partial to the odd shooting game such as counter strike global offensive.

This is where I decided to branch out again and see what it is like on the coding side of things so I found this 3 week course to see what it was all about and what it is actually like. My experience so far has been a positive one in the skills I have picked up and applied to things like the team game. I am also intrigued to see what its like to see what the website development is like as we have just started that as part our first assignment. I would of preferred the classroom experience as it would of suited my learning style a little more but due to current situation this wasn't an option. But I am making the most and learning a lot through the way we are doing it now online using the platforms Slack, Zoom, Google hangouts, flow diagrams website and Trello for the action boards we are using.
