<h2>1.3 - Planing and carrying out tasks using IT</h2>
<p>
This is the easy part. All you need is a Trello board setting up using the Trello website. Its easy to do and even easier to follow once set up. The best bit of all its even free to use so wont cost you or the company any charges or monthly / yearly subscription charges You can set up multiple columns like to do list, a doing list and then finally a done list. Also for each item on the list you can set up and personalise an individual member or members of that team or even the whole team and if needed multiple teams which tells everyone at once who should be doing what with who and when.
<ul>
    <li>To do list which is to tell who or what team what tasks they have to do.</li>
    <li>A column that shows what people are working and who should be working on it if its more than one person or team.</li>
    <li>A done list which will tell you who or what team has completed their tasks. </li>
    <li>You can also check on when the activity was completed or moved to doing column.</li>
</p>
<p>
Here is my very own Trello board that I am using for this assignment that I am currently working on</li>.</ol>

But before you jump straight in to making a Trello board up to use you and your employees can all set up a flow chart to make sure that they are following the project as expected. I also used a website to do this as me and the team I was a part of developed our text based games as a unit.
</p> 
<p>  
The site we all used used to do our flow charts after the planning was diagrams.net
</p>
<p>
The picture below is of all 4 peoples sections of the game linked together as a whole flow chart.

The picture below is just of my section of the game as a flow chart.

Here is a link to our overall flow chart and then each individual persons flow chart for there section of the overall story for the game which was called Jungle Rumble.
