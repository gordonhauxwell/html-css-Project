    As with everything we come across in our daily lives there is always going to benefits and draw backs to everything we do.
</p>
<p> 
    First lets talk about the benefits or positive things that I have noticed when making my website. I have noticed that my writing skills are good and each answer is just the correct length for that subject in my mind. I have also used images to enhance the background of the pages to make them more appealing to look at and show another skill that is used to apply this to the pages. Like when we did the game the planning process was quick as we all decided the start and end together and then each did our own section of the game as we liked to using our own minds. This was good as we could use our own imaginations for that section of the game and do exactly what we wanted to with them sections. It was also good to work as a team as when it came to piecing all the code together we could send that section to join together with the rest. From there we all added our sections of the game ran tests to see where the issues lay if there was any. Then we used screen share to go to where the issue lay and worked as a team to fix them so the game had no bugs in the final product in time for the deadline. Doing this a team added the fact that it only took about ¼ of the time to code the full game as we all did equal sections of the game.
</p>
<p>
    When it came to my own website it was easy for me to type all the answers out as I am a confident and quick at typing compared to some people. I am not the worst fastest by any means but also at the same time definitely far from the slowest. This made it easy to type the answers out from notes to word file page to just copy and paste in to VS code to amend to make the text look correct in appearance. Once I got my head around the coding on VS code it was quite easy to do basic changes to make the text appear correctly on the page as it was in the word format. This included separating the paragraphs if there were splits between them. Another positive aspect of doing it all on your own is that all the work is yours and you can share it on GitHub and things like that to show what you have done when finished. This makes all the work your own so you can only put one name to it and that is your own name.
</p>
<p>
    The down sides to all this is are.
    <ul>
    <li>Planning stage takes longer to do.</li>
    <li>The team may have different ideas about what to do.</li>
    <li>Different ideas on what to do when doing it.</li>
    <li>You have to agree and possibly compromise with each other on each others ideas. Which would be carriedout over a discussion to each other.</li>
    <li>Pages may get mixed up when sending it over to the other people or when receiving the code from other people.</li>
    <li>The whole project is not personal any more as you have to name the other people involved in it.</li> 
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    I could have been a bit more efficient in the way I carried out this task buy researching basic code and html code so I wasn’t starting from fresh with no previous knowledge. Also in a team some one could of lined all the answers up in text form and then pass it on to some one else to add all the pictures and style the site this would have been easier as one person has a personal writing style so the site would be consistent with that. The other person would have what you wanted in mind by you telling them styling wise and they could focus on getting good high quality images to use as background and style them to fit the text when the text came through. The bonus of this is that the person could then individually style the pages to suit the text. This would save time to allow the other person to just concentrate on the writing of the text for the site and the other person to amend the appearance to suit that text and page around what the person wanted.

<p>
    The ways I can improve productivity and efficiency would be as I have already said I would play in to each other strengths and weaknesses if one person was a strong and good typist I would have them do all the written work and as that is done area / page by page send it on to the coding person to code the overall appearance. This would benefit both people involved as they only have one task to do at a time and the task they are most confident in carrying out. This then allows each person to focus on the task they are best at and it would be a far better over product as both people would do the best for the text and appearance to make the site an overall better experience for the user.
</p>
<p>
    Also I would of proffered the classroom experience than the online based on we did because pf the current circumstances of isolation and all that. This is because it would have been easier to see the instructors in the room and ask them for there help straight away. If they were busy in a work related call with in the company you would also see that and leave them to finish that call. Same as if they were helping an individual. Through the online option I did these were hard to judge and if they were on other calls or helping someone else you would have to wait and ask later on when you think they are free to help you out. If you chose to use google to help you until they were free they could be out dated sites with formerly used code and not been updated to match current codes or even complex explanations on how to do things. This would obviously slow down the efficiency of the that person involved. That being said as the instructors are use to all this they could offer simplified explanations for things vs a web explanation. This for me would give me a more efficient outcome than web based explanations.
</p>
<p>
    Personally for me as coding is not my strong point I would of just liked to get on with answering of the text based question and pass the coding and appearance on to a more confident person. As I have also said above I would also of proffered face to face but made the best of the online option as it was the only option for that time as it would of suited myself a lot better in how I carry tasks / assignments out. This would of just let me concentrate on my tasks as an individual rather than the whole over all tasks to complete the final product doing everything on my own as the coding was personally harder for me to get use to. Also doing it on my own I could do it at my own pace and do extra work over night as and when needed.

<p>
    As mentioned before there are digital solutions to solve my own productivity
    <ul>
    <li>Research more in to the coding side of things</li>
    <li>Apply the research to project</li>
    <li>Id prefer to work as a team as a pose to on my own.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>  
    <p>
    What I would personally like to do to make the project quicker is me type all the answers out to a file then send that file through a tool like slack for that to then mess with the appearance and make it look as an over all project instead one person working on both at the same time. This involved juggling the tasks about both writing the answers out and coding the pages to achieve the best possible result that person could manage on their own. Next time I had a project like this to do I would research the appearance aspect side of coding so I wouldn’t have to rely on other people to do this for me. I did like how we could screen share to the instructors to get around issues in stead of having to explain it to them from how it would appear on your screen to you and explain that so it made sense to them. on the other hand you also didn’t have to take the time to explain it to them and then re-explain if any thing was not understood from their side of things. Screen share saved all this time by sending exactly what is on your screen to their screens. Also by doing this it is a mirror image of your screen so as you move the cursor it moves on theirs as well so what ever you do it is mirrored on theirs. This allows you and them to work as a unit at the same time to see what is wrong on your side of things and then they can see and talk you through the changes and how to them from their side as work with them from your side to correct the code or even get the code working.
</p>
<p>
    Also to check that we were doing the tasks and not time wasting as it was an online course and you could mute yourself and even turn the camera off so you were totally hidden. We used a tool called slack as mentioned earlier in this assignment. Through this we could actually copy and paste our codes as a comment or even put a screen shot of our screens on there so the instructors could see it and see if it would work or not. Putting our code as a comment allowed the to just copy and paste our code into there VS code and check it works for themselves. If there were issues they could instantly see it from their side and either comment back how to correct it or get you to share your screen if zoom was available to do so meaning no one was doing a screen share as it can only support one screen share at a time. This was abit of an issues if more than one person was having an issues as it took the zoom share up for them and an instructor to work with them. As in a classroom you could of got instructor helping one individual and the other just walking around and checking the other peoples screens as they work. The only problem with the online option was that as you imagine the internet was busy all the time not just at peak hours as people used it to work from home, watch online streaming services such as Netflix, Social media sites, general web sites such as news and researching a hobby or interest and of like my self and this group of people on this course other people like us doing online courses. This led to the video and audio cutting out or stuttering on use so we couldn’t hear what was being said at all. This also means that if for any reason some ones router or internet provider had issues that person would not be able to connect to zoom for presentations or screen shares for examples of the code we were covering at that time. Not only would it affect zoom but everything to do with all web based services like slack.  This would also affect your Trello service as that too is web based so you couldn’t add anything to do or change things as you were doing or completed them. As you yourself had issues that would affect the instructors ability to see this and communicate with you. The classroom would have sorted this by them actually being in the same room so you could instantly say there was an issue and how to solve the issue affecting you or everyone. This would also be a good way to see where the issue lay either in the whole set up or just you and your set up.

    Its not that hard to go about testing your digital projects and get responses about it. You could publish your work on GitHub for people to see that way you don't have to wait and be asked by the person to personally send them your work. Also with in doing this you can gather feed back from multiple sources and then apply if wanted to the over all product you are working on. On the other hand you can send it to other people and then as they look at it they can highlight any issues or concerns about the site or even give an overall positive and negatives if they felt there was any with in the site back to personally. From all this feed back you can work on the final product again and improve on any improvements you wish top make and then go back to them and ask for feedback and see if the negatives have rectified themselves out or not. Again from all this feed back you gain knowledge in what is good and bad what to do and what to avoid doing. This then all adds up a far better experience for the user on your site you yourself also get more confident in getting thing right the first time and the feedback should become more positive with less negatives over time. As well with the back is its not your ideas being put forward as others may also put there ideas foreword to you on things to improve or change.
