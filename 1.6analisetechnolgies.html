    <h2>>1.6 - Analysis technologies helped me achive my outcomes.</h2>
<p>
There were 3 chosen technologies we used on the Codenation Course. These were as follows

    • Trello.com
    • Diagrams.net
    • GitHub
</p>
<p>
Trello
</p>
<p>
When we were designing and making our games as a team and even doing our assignments alone Trello was a helpful tool to have as it allowed to plan each step and see what each other in terms of the game was up to so we didnt have to ask them where they were up to all the time. When doing my own assignments I could use it to organises what needed doing and what I was doing and what was done as I was working on it. Also the instructors didn't have to ask us as they could just look at out Trello board and see for them selves. With having the board you can organise all the to do things out in order in a list then as you are doing them move them to doing so you and others know you are working on it at that time and also if there is something left in the to do list you know you have missed a section/ part of the assignment / work out.
</p>
<p>
GitHub
<p>    
GitHub is a very good tool to store and get people to look at your codes. They can also just download the files or go to the site and look at them as intended. It is also a good place to them update your projects to as it is web based and your projects will always be safe. While its on the site as well you can send your link out for other people to access with out having to send them the files or folders to do so.

<p>
Diagrams.net
</p>
<p>
diagrams. Net helped up plan and follow our projects with flow charts. One we had the flow chart it was easy to follow where we were upto and where we were going with that step / stage. It wasq easy to follow and simple to use and join up making it easy to produce flowcharts for me and then linking the whole teams charts together when the team had finished.
