    <h2> 1.1 - The purpose of IT in modern business </h2>
    </p>
<p>
This breaks down to the 4 areas I have highlighted below.
<ol> 
<li> Communications </li>
<li> Inventory lists / Stock levels </li>
<li>Information Management </li>
<li>Information and data Storage </li>
</ol></p>
<p>
1. Communications

Communications are a large part of any modern business. This maybe as simple as collogues keeping each other up to date via email. This is a simple but yet affective form of communication between colleagues or teams. Also you may choose to have each team on a platform such as slack so they can send instant messages and images and then they are able to get instant replies between them or as a team if they are in teams.

This image below shows an example from the Code Nation 3 week coding course I attended.

2. Company lists

As a large company or even a small company just beginning your life out you will have lists to keep. These lists may include staff members, wage sheets, stock level if needed. I.T will help you do this in a safe / secure manner and also the most efficient way to do these. These lists can be added or items / people to be taken out or people taken out whenever needed to by someone or if they are in a team or teams they can influence and save the list so its up to date for the next time or even person to use following on or from them. 
</p>

3. Information management

Information management allows you to keep upto date with things like.
 
    • Tracking sales / expenses
      
    • keep an eye on the level of things on the list and how people are treating the lists and if they are doing this to the level expected or even if it is just done correctly with all the correct details in place.
      
    • You can also manage any strange things appearing on the list / lists that you can question the correct people involved to get to an explanation of why this is on the list and if it really has to be there. Also if there was any strange items on the list you would easily be able to see this and then follow up with the customer to make it was them and not someone else / scams
      
    • Also if you were a retail company you could look at what the customers are buying / similar items to them and maybe even make a happier customer experience by making up there own offers like so many extra points or so much off this item when you next buy it. (e.g With Tesco and their royalty system which is the chains Tesco club card. When you get your Tesco club card vouchers they are linked to and around what that customers buying habits reflect. (e.g With Morrisons its there more card and they print random vouchers off at the till for the customer there and then. These can then be used in the chain at any store to get money off or extra points to their card. This all together will make for a happier customer who will be more willing to use you as there is an incentive to keep coming back to yourselves. So this will also build up a customer company relationship which will benefit you both. The customer as they are getting bonuses or money off and yourselves as the customer is more likely to keep coming back to yourselves.
</p>

4. Information and data Storage

As a company you will be able to get rid of all paper method and storage system (e.g File cabinates or record boxes) and move forward to a new easy and simple solution yet instant solaution to save and store files.

The information and data you build up with in you company will then have to be saved to a centralised storage unit. This is most commonly a server where all you data goes in to and out of it self to each persons computer so they can work on it. Once they have finished they just save the amended file back to the server for next time they wish to use it. This is a safe method of storage as it stores the most up to date file for use by people.

You could even have 2-3 servers running together that are an exact copy of each other so if a file is changed on one it changes on the other. This way you will always have a working copy. This is similar to what people do with there own PC’s in the form of RAID on there hard drives. Its just a way of always having a copy to work at any time even if one of them was to stop working completely.
