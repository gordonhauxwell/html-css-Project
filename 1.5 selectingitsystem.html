    <h2>1.5 - Selecting and using IT systems and software – Selecting the right technology for the job in hand?</h2>
<p>
    Selecting the correct systems and software just involves a bit of research from yourself or your company as a whole to see what they want to use the systems for and if then the software can do the functions that you want to carry out on them.

    Like if you were a wholesale company and you had sales people out and about promoting your companies products it would be advisable to look at at laptop system with Wi-Fi or a cellular network just like your mobile phone for them instead of a desktop. The bonus of the laptop if just the portability of the machine and the easy of use in what ever premises you are at. Having Wi-Fi access would allow you to connect to their Wi-Fi service and send orders or information over to the main server where you are based. But not everyone may have Wi-Fi in there premises so then it would have to fall back on to a cellular network in order to send the data back to the server where you are based. Both will have the same result but Wi-Fi will be faster and of course free as you don't need a data plan to use it like you do a cellular network. Like on your phone you have a data plan to access sites and apps which uses data to send and receive information like Facebook.

    But for around the office I would recommend desktop systems and a hardwire network setup. This would allow fast and instant file transfer between the server and system or the system back to the server. There would also be no Wi-Fi so as above there would be no Wi-Fi compromises to take advantage of making Wi-Fi weaker / secure option. Also if the Wi-Fi router was to stop working for some reason you would still be able to send information to and from the server without the use of Wi-Fi because it uses the wires instead.
    You also will have to choose a suitable server for your needs as a business there is no point in spending 10’s of thousands of pound for a server when you could of bought on that does the same for your company for as much as a high end PC (e.g £1000 - £1200). all you need to do is look at what size files and the amount of you need to store all these files correctly. Like I have explained before you can set up RAID system on the hard drives in the server so you could 2-3 drives overall your main one and then 2 back ups. As these are in RAID configuration they will be identical mirror copies of each other. A more expensive way would to have 2 servers that are a mirror copy of each other but this would require twice the money to achieve. But the added bonus of 2 servers is if one was to break down you would just use the other so work can still be done and stored. If your company only had one then the result would be a stop in work until the issues on the only server was solved / repaired by your I.T team.

    Another thing you could do is have a number of spare peripherals safe in storage for use probably with you I.T team. What I mean by this is basically having spare parts such as mice, keyboards, headsets / webcams if they are used to even the odd spare monitor/screen incease any stop working at anytime they can just simply be swapped over in a matter of minutes so the person doesn't really have to stop working for that long. You could also always have a spare desktop / laptop spare you they can also be swapped out if anything happened to them or they stopped working.
