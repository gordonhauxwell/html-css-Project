    there are many file types that are used in website. There is .jpg, .jfif and .png this is and example of just three file types for images. Then you have CSS for styling the website as well as HTML files for the basic sites them selves. You can also add short funny clips to sites in the form of .gif or you could also add full videos to it. You could also like a .pdf to the site if you had a sales book to look at. This would also work if you had a file you wanted someone to print out and use at a later date. This will make it accessible to the person to look at with out having to contact you for the book or file.
