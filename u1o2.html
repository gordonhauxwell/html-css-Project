2.1
</p> 
<p>
There has been two main items that we used during the three week code nation course these were Virtual Studio Code program and Trello website.
</p>
Virtual Studio Code or VS code for short is what we learnt the basics on. We started with Java script and all the aspects  to do with that these were.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dotnotations</li>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>If else statements</li>
    <li>Case statements</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Loops</li>
</ul>
<p>
These were all the aspects that would eventually become part of game that we built as a team of four. Along the way we were given tasks to work on to see if we were following and to see if we could code something that appeared on the terminal with the correct outcomes for the functions we were doing at that time. 
</p>
<p>
Personally I found part a bit full on as there was a lot of information to take in and then also apply to do tasks which would then focus on the area of Java script we were covering at that time. Then we ran our Java script code through the terminal in VS code to get the correct outcomes presented in the terminal on VS code for what task we were doing. But as it was just the beginning of the course and I had no knowledge around coding at all I could follow what was going on and code things to get the correct outcome in the terminal. This was achieved through writing my own code and if it didnt work try and see where I did it wrong or ask the instructors for there help which was usually just a small mistake that was easily fixed like a missing speech mark where needed or semi colon at the of that particular line of code.
</p>
<p>
After we learnt the basics and worked with them for a bit to get use to them we then had to work as a team to build a text based game. My team was a team of four we worked together and decided what the story was around. Once we had agreed to what the story was around we set up was going to be involved in each part of the game as team. Then once all this was in place we each started to work on our own section of the game and use our own thoughts about what was happening within our sections of the game. We then coded our own parts of the game as we wished to and then joined all the codes up in order to produce a final product. The best part about working as a team was that instead of relying on the instructor all the time we could work it out the code and mistakes together and make it easier to get a final product which we liked. Then all we had to do as a team from there was agree the ending text to our game and apply that code to the final game to make it complete.   
</p>
<p>
Then after the game we started to build our websites from the assignments that were given through out the course which built up over the course and not given all at once which I considered to be a bonus as you knew what was to be done and when and not move to far ahead and confuse or stress yourself out to much by trying to research things to much.
</p>
<p>
Then we moved on to html which we used to copy our text from our assignments in to then get our basic text in place for the website we were making. Once we had our text in place we were shown how to do basic styling with css in VS code. Using this I applied some basic styling to the site like font style and heading colours. I also introduced pictures into the background of each page on the website and added a background to the text to make it easier to read against the image it self. 
</p>
<p>
We used Trello which is a to see what we had to do with in our section of the game / story. From this we could see where each other were up to in relation to the overall game development. We also added extra ideas to the Trello board to add in to the game to make it better if we had time this was things like adding an image to the background of each section of the game related to that section. There is older ways to do what in digital form on the Trello site this would be things like a board with sticky notes that people move around like we did. This would be a harder to follow method as sticky notes may be lost or fall off the board. Then everybody would get a false impression of the overall progress throughout the projects timeline. With using the digital method there is no chance of this happening and you dont even have to get up and leave your desk to update the board like you would have to in the sticky notes method.

</p>
<p>
For what we have been doing so far VS code and Trello have been appropriate in the way in has helped us reach the final outcome of the final product for the deadline in place on the course.
</p>
<p>
VS code has been appropriate because it was easy to use and the different colours on the screen help you to identify certain aspects of your code making it easier to read from the screen when working with your code. It has also been able to let us add background images and images to our website to help us explain our answers if needed like I have on my site. VS code is also very easy to use in the way the code and the terminal are on one screen so you don't have to change screens all the time to see if your code is working.
</p>
<p>
Trello has been appropriate when I have been planning and carrying out tasks either on the game or on my own as it has allowed me to plan in stages what to do and be able to see what stages need doing in the over all projects of the text based game and website assignments. This was helpful as you could just look at what has to be done and what you are doing at any given time. This was also monitored by the instructors to see where everyone was up to when ever they needed to know as this was done over the internet and not in the usual way of face to face. 
</p>
<p>
As for the circumstances around the 3 week course we were doing it was at the time there was isolation in place apart from shops exercise and work if it can’t be done from home. This was not the ideal setting for me personally but I stuck with it and managed to learn lots of information about coding and how to apply it. But we used some extra tools in the form of zoom and google hangouts.
</p>
<p>
These two tools were much the same thing we just used them differently to achieve different results. Zoom was used as the central hub for everyone to communicate through as it used our webcams to show our video feed and microphone so they could here what each other were saying. For me the bonus was having a webcam with a built in microphone so there was no added complications in setting them up and extra costs for equipment to get it to work. Another added bonus of zoom was it could hold everyone on the course at one in one session. This was easy for the instructors as they knew who was online and could see us at the same time so they could potentially see if were struggling or if we waved our hands for help or nodded our heads for agreement to moving on if we were moving on. Google hangouts was used in a similar way but we used this for the team work and  1 to 1 sessions with the instructors if we needed further help or had further questions. Another bonus of both of these tools was the ability to share our screen so the other users could see it if needed. This came in handy for the game as we could check each others code when things were not working and we had to see and work out why and then work as a team to sort these issues out. When the instructors where starting a section of work for us to learn they did this so we could all the slides and follow what is being said. In the classroom there is big screens that everyone uses to look at these and follow them at the same time as the instructor explained it. When we did it it was similar but instead of the big screens we had the slides shared through the internet from the instructors computer screen to our own screens. Then as mentioned before the audio was there so they could just explain it as they were going through the presentation and we could follow it as they were sharing it through the internet. This was hard to get use to but once use to it it was like being in your very own private classroom in the comfort of your own home. You had the presentation being done in front of you and the instructors explaing every step of the way as they usually would. As we all had webcams we could also cut in and ask any question at any time just like we could in the classroom and they would answer this or go back a little in the presentation to the relevant points.
</p>
<p>
2.3
<p>
    I can honestly say that the website is for from perfect but as I had to write all my answers and code the pages on the site as well I feel that the outcome shows that. If I was to do this again I would research more around the CSS and styling aspects of the site and improve the overall look of the site for next time I had to do one. Also if I was given a set amount of days to write all the answers out and then had a set number of days to work on the styling this may have been better as you don’t have to do both at once. I actually have never built a website before so I feel that the result is the best I can manage with the time limit we had. I was also doing 2 – 2.5 hours a night in my own time a day to cut down the work I had to do with in the working hours as well. This helped me do more coding in these hours as the instructors we there to help me with any complications. I had completed all the writing and basic styling to make it look better and easier to navigate with a nav bar. With more time I would of liked to fit a better nav bar in with a better professional look in stead of the basic one I have chosen for this project. The out come I feel is a good one considering I have never done this before and didn’t really have a lot of thoughts on how it should look. I worked the images into the pages once they were done and resized them to make it all easier for me.  
</p>
<p>
Of course I would like to work on this in my own time in the future and make it a better over all product and better look at and use. Like I said I would first like to add a better more professional looking nav bar. I would then chance some of the pictures opacity and over all quality to make a better to look at web site. Would also look at changing other aspects to with individual heading colour to make them suit the chosen background.
</p>
<p>
2.4
</p>
<p>
Further improvements I could make to my website would involve looking at making the background images less prominent and bold. I would achieve this by researching in to and how to carry this out and then apply it to my code and work on each image to make each page easier to read the text off. But as we had to stick to a deadline set by the coursed we only 5 days to research and type out our answers ready for the website. Apply each section its own correct page. Then we moved on to the styling including headings, heading colours and background images for each page if used like I have getting them all to the correct size for the pages we were doing. This included making them bigger or smaller depending on the image to make it fit the page. As we were doing all this at once I found it quite hard to work it all at once so prioritized the text over the styling properly. This again is something I can work on at a later date and make it perfect from the way It currently sits at the deadline. I can then show any improvements or changes I have done by using GitHub to republish these updates to my portfolio and show people what changes I have made and how they applied to the page and show the differences.
</p>
<p>
2.5
</p>
<p>
Given the deadline limit of 5 days from start to finish I think I made a decent website with all my answers wrote out as I wanted and roughly styled to show how I can make changes to background images and fonts and heading if I wanted to. As I explained above to make it perfect I would change the opacity of the backgrounds on each page to suit the writing on that given page. I could also go about positing the titles of page to the centre to make it look better and reposition the images used with in the text on certain pages to make a better over all better looking web page.
